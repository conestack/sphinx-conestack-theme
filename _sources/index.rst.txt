Behaviour
---------

This sphinx theme is created with responsive design in mind.

.. Tip::

    Try resizing this page to see the effect!

The conestack sphinx template works on the following breakpoints:

- mobile: ``max-width: 768px``

- tablet: ``min-width: 769px`` and ``max-width: 991px``

- desktop: ``min-width: 992px``


Mobile View
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is lesser or equal than 768px, no sidebars will be visible.

The global table of contents and searchbar are accessible from a dropdown menu
in the header.


Tablet View
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is greater than 769px and smaller than 991px, the global
table of contents is visible and the local table of contents is hidden.

The search box appears in the header element.


Desktop View
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is greater than 992px, both global TOC and
local TOC are visible as left and right sidebar, respectively.

The search box appears in the header element.
